# Design rating platform

## Task

```

Let's say a customer rents 5 different products (furniture) from CasaOne. We need to capture the ratings from the customer for all of these products after customer starts using the furniture. We also need to display the ratings on the website next to the product. This product rating feature is similar to product ratings on Flipkart and Amazon



Here is what you can submit as part of the assignment

- How will you design the flow. Architecture diagram with an explanation will help. What will the user do and what will the system do

- Code for API to fetch ratings for the product. This should also return average product rating and count for individual ratings



NOTE: Please make assumptions where required and highlight them when sharing your response.
