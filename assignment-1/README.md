# Product variables growth

## Task

```
Every product (furniture item) has an associated product ID. There are some variables that are fixed to the product and we know them when we buy the product. Examples for fixed variables: color, finish, purchase price etc



There are few variables we need to now capture which are derived

- Ops related variables

Examples: Time to assemble the product, cost of assembly etc

Note that these derived variables can change in value over a period of time as well. For example, the delivery crew can handle the installation better since they become experts and the 'Time to assemble the product' variable changes.

I want to know your thoughts on these

So far, we have handled the fixed variables well. How do you think we should proceed with the 'derived' variables? How do we bake it into our system? If the business teams need to make a decision based on the derived variables, how will you help the teams get it? How will you ensure that the 'derived values' are updated with the latest value.
